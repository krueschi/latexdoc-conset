# latexdoc-conset
A simple construction set for LaTeX documents.

It's meant to be a boilerplate kit for manual composing LaTeX documents
from example snippets.

As this set is for personal use most of the content and examples are
in German language. Don't expect to get an international version but
probably I will add some variables for English (or even universal) usage
later.

## Dependencies
